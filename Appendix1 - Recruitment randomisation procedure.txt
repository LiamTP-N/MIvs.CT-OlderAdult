Recruitment randomisation procedure: This randomisation was conducted in cycles: each intervention group was assigned a number from one to four. As participants signed up, they were randomly assigned a group using an online random number generator (Google). This process continued until only one group remained, at which point the last participant in that age group was automatically assigned to the remaining group. Upon filling all four intervention groups, the allocation cycle started over. This approach aimed to ensure a balanced distribution across the intervention groups within each age group, with the order of sign-up serving as a further randomising factor.
